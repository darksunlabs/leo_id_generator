# Leo ID Generator

Leo doesn't have a string type so it can sometimes be difficult to generate IDs such as transaction IDs that reflect the sender and the receiver and the timestamp of the operation. This code snippet is one way to resolve this issue by converting these details into an Aleo Address form, that can be readily used in Aleo Smart Contracts.
